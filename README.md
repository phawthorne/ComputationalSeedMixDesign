# Computational Seed Mix Design Demo Tool

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Live%20demo-brightgreen)](https://phawthorne.github.io/computational-seed-mix-design/)

This is an interactive tool demo to accompany "Computational Seed Mix Design" (Barak, et al. 2021). This
is a prototype of a visualization component of a larger tool we are developing that will allow interactive
building and optimization of seed mixes based on national data. 

This demo illustrates browsing through thousands of optimization outputs to identify mixes that meet
desired criteria.
